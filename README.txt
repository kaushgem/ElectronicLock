Steps to use the device
=====================================================

NOTE: Look at Device Usage Guide if you have trouble interacting with the device

1) Enter the code so it gets latched on the seven segment display

2) Now check the code using switch [4]
		o If code is correct, device unlocks and the leds blink
		o If code is incorrect for the first time, the device locks again
		o If code is incorrect for the second time, the device pauses for 20 seconds

3) Once the device is unlocked, to lock it back use switch [5]

4) If the device is paused, it will return back to locked state after 20 seconds. Only after this you can further enter your code

5) If code entering is not completed within 30 seconds the device locks itself.
